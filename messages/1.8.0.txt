Version 1.8.0

* Added new option `add_comments`. Works with BEM nesting enabled. Generate full class names as a comments before nested BEM elements and modifiers. This is useful for finding selectors by class names.
* Added new option `comment_style` to control output when `add_comments` enabled.

Thanks, Jaak Ritso!
